# Toy C (`tc`) Compiler

A hobby C-like compiler project ‚Äî built with **GCC**, targeting **x86 assembly** via **NASM**. The `tc` compiler includes a complete pipeline: **Lexing**, **Parsing**, **Semantic Analysis**, **Code Optimization**, and **Assembly Code Generation**.

---

## üöÄ Features

### üî§ Lexer
Generates tokens from source code. Supports:
- **Keywords**: `exit`, `int`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `do`
- **Identifiers**
- **Integer literals** in:
  - Decimal
  - Hexadecimal (`0x...`)
  - Binary (`0b...`)
  - Octal (`0...`)

### üß† Parser + Semantic Analyzer
Combines syntax parsing and semantic validation with several code optimizations:
- **Block-scoped symbol table management**
  - Symbol tables are created and destroyed within block scopes (`{ }`)
- **Tree Representation**:
  - Uses **Left-Child Right-Sibling (LCRS)** structure:
    - Each statement node points to its first child (leftmost child)
    - Subsequent statements in the same scope are linked as siblings (right pointers)
- **Optimizations**:
  - Constant folding
  - Copy propagation
  - Constant propagation
  - Loop unrolling

### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Generator
- Directly generates **x86 assembly** using NASM syntax
- **Dead code elimination**:
  - Picks only the **first reachable `exit`** statement, discards unreachable code

## Build Requirements

- GCC
- NASM
- Make

## Building

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make` to build the compiler
3. Use `make clean` to remove build artifacts

## Known Issues

- Memory management: Current version shows memory leaks in valgrind (e.g., test14.tc shows ~1.3MB lost in ~32k blocks after 25k iterations)
- Looking for collaborators to help identify and fix memory leaks

## Future Improvements

- Complete elimination of memory leaks
- Additional optimizations
- Expanded language features

## ü§ù Contributing

This is currently a solo project, but I'd love to collaborate with others to improve it! üöÄ
