# Toy C (`tc`) Compiler

A hobby C-like compiler project ‚Äî built with **GCC**, targeting **x86 assembly** via **NASM**. The `tc` compiler includes a complete pipeline: **Lexing**, **Parsing**, **Semantic Analysis**, **Code Optimization**, and **Assembly Code Generation**.

---

## üöÄ Features

### üî§ Lexer
Generates tokens from source code. Supports:
- **Keywords**: `exit`, `int`, `if`, `else`, `while`, `do`
- **Identifiers**
- **Integer literals** in:
  - Decimal
  - Hexadecimal (`0x...`)
  - Binary (`0b...`)
  - Octal (`0...`)

## üß† Parser + Semantic Analyzer

Combines syntax parsing and semantic validation with several code optimizations.

### üì¶ Block-Scoped Symbol Table Management
- Symbol tables are created and destroyed within block scopes (`{ }`)
- Ensures proper variable scoping and memory management

### üå≥ Tree Representation
**Uses Left-Child Right-Sibling (LCRS) structure:**
- Each statement node points to its first child (leftmost child)
- Subsequent statements in the same scope are linked as siblings (via right pointers)

**‚úÖ Flexible Design:**
```text
Statement Blocks:           Expression Trees:
      Node                       +
     /    \                    /   \
Child    Sibling            a       *
                                  /   \
                                 b     c
```

**üå≥ LCRS Tree Structure Example**

**Source Code:**
```c
stmt1;
{
    stmt2;
    stmt3;
}
stmt4;
```

**üå≥ Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Structure**

#### üìê Visual Representation
```text
      PROGRAM
         |
       stmt1 ‚Üí BLOCK ‚Üí stmt4
                |
              stmt2 ‚Üí stmt3
```

### üîÑ Dual-Purpose Structure
The same tree architecture serves two roles:

**1. For Statements**  
Represents block hierarchy with:
- Left child ‚Üí First statement in block  
- Right child ‚Üí Next sibling statement  

**2. For Expressions**  
Builds operator trees where:
- Root node ‚Üí Operator (e.g. `+`, `*`)  
- Left child ‚Üí Left operand  
- Right child ‚Üí Right operand (or next operator in chained expressions)  

**Key Benefit:**  
Enables uniform traversal logic for both control flow and expressions.

### üöÄ Optimizations
| Optimization         | Description                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Constant Folding     | Pre-computes constant expressions   |
| Copy Propagation     | Replaces redundant variable copies  |
| Constant Propagation | Spreads known constant values       |
| Loop Unrolling       | Expands loops for speed optimization|

### üöÄ Loop Unrolling Implementation

#### üîÑ While Loops:
```c
while (condition) { block }
```
#### üîß Processing Flow
1. **First Iteration**:
   - Parse condition and block exactly once
   - Preserve these nodes for final AST generation
   - Execute block to update symbol table state

2. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Re-parse condition using current symbol values
   - Re-parse block with updated symbol table
   - Discard AST nodes after capturing symbol updates
   - Continue until condition evaluates to false

#### üîÑ Do-While Loops
```c
do { block } while (condition);
```
#### üîß Processing Flow
1. **First Iteration**  
   - Executes block unconditionally (honoring do-while semantics)  
   - Parses condition after block execution  
   - Preserves these nodes for final AST generation  

2. **Subsequent Iterations**  
   - Re-parses block with current symbol values  
   - Re-evaluates condition with updated variables  
   - Discards AST nodes after capturing side effects  
   - Continues until condition becomes false  

#### ‚ö° Core Optimization Properties
```diff
+ Live Symbol Table Updates
  - Direct mutations (no snapshots)
  - Changes persist across iterations
  - Single authoritative source for variable states (symbol table)

+ Semantic Accuracy
  - While: Condition checked before each iteration
  - Do-While: Condition checked after each iteration
  - Both: First iteration always preserved in AST

+ Memory Efficiency
  - Only first iteration nodes retained
  - Subsequent nodes parsed/discarded
  - No AST bloat from unrolling
```

### ‚úÖ Optimization Guarantees

| Feature               | Implementation Details                                                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Semantic Accuracy** | Precisely matches runtime behavior through live symbol table updates                   |
| **Memory Efficiency** | Zero memory overhead - no snapshots, reuses existing symbol table structures           |
| **Variable Propagation** | Real-time value updates through direct symbol table mutations during each iteration  |
| **Nested Support**    | Fully handles nested loops via scope stack with proper lexical scoping                 |
| **Code Generation**   | Optimized output containing only first iteration nodes with all side effects preserved |

**Key Insight**:  
The implementation achieves loop unrolling through iterative re-parsing while maintaining 100% correct semantics via:
- Live symbol table updates between iterations
- Precise condition re-evaluation
- Selective AST node retention (first iteration only)
- Full scope stack integration for nested cases

### ‚öôÔ∏è Code Generator
- Directly generates **x86 assembly** using NASM syntax
- **Dead code elimination**:
  - Picks only the **first reachable `exit`** statement, discards unreachable code

## Build Requirements

- GCC
- NASM
- Make

## Building

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `make` to build the compiler
3. Use `make clean` to remove build artifacts

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

After building, compile a `.tc` file to x86 assembly:
```bash
./build/main tests/test.tc  # Compiles test.tc -> outputs NASM assembly
```

## Known Issues

- Memory management: Current version shows memory leaks in valgrind (e.g., test14.tc shows ~1.3MB lost in ~32k blocks after 25k iterations)
- Looking for collaborators to help identify and fix memory leaks

## Future Improvements

- Complete elimination of memory leaks
- Additional optimizations
- Expanded language features

## ü§ù Contributing

This is currently a solo project, but I'd love to collaborate with others to improve it! üöÄ
